# birthday-email-sender

This is an educational project that I completed within Day 32 of this course

This app takes a csv with birthday details of people who you wish to congratulate on their birthday. 
It then checks what day it is today and if it happens to be a birthday of any of your friends, then it will send a birthday
letter (randomly picked from 3 letter templates) to their email.
